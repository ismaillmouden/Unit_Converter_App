About Unit Converter

This Unit Converter application was developed by me "Ismail"  as a training project to enhance my programming skills, specifically with the Flet framework. The idea behind this app is to provide a simple yet effective tool for converting between various units of measurement, including length, weight, volume, time, and temperature.

Key Features:
- Convert between common units of length, such as meters, kilometers, and miles.
- Supports weight conversions, including kilograms, pounds, and more.
- Easily switch between volume units like liters and gallons.
- Perform time conversions from hours to minutes or seconds.
- Includes temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

How to Use:
1. Enter the value you want to convert.
2. Select the unit you're converting from and the unit you're converting to.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the result.

This project was inspired by a YouTube channel called Rakwan, where I learned about the Flet framework. The source code for this application will be available on GitHub as an open-source project, and I hope it can contribute to my growing resume and benefit others in similar learning journeys.

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to this project!
